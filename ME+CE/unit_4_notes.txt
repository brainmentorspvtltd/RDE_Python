File Handling
2 types of files in system...
- text
- binary (images, audio, video...)

1. Open File
2. Read/Write
3. File Close

Syntax for file handling :
file = open('file_path', 'mode', by_default mode = 'r')
data = file.read()
print(data)
file.close()

Modes for file handling
by default for handling text files
- r - open file in read mode
- w - open file in write mode, overwrite the file if exist, else it 
will create a new file
- a - open file in write mode, it appends the data in file 
- x - open file in write mode, it will always create a new file,
if file already exist then it will raise error
====================================
if we want to read/write a binary file
- rb
- wb
- ab
- xb
====================================

Exception Handling
- try   = this block contains the business logic part
- except = this block handles the error/exception raised in try block
- finally = this block will always execute
- else   = if try block get executed successfully then else block will 
           execute
